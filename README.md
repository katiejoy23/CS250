# CS 250 Portfolio Artifact: Agile Sprint Review & Retrospective  

## **Essential Questions Reflection**  

### 1. Interpreting User Needs Through User Stories  
User stories (e.g., "As a traveler, I want to filter flights by price") bridge gaps between technical and business requirements. I interpret needs by:  
- Collaborating with stakeholders to define acceptance criteria  
- Breaking stories into tasks (e.g., UI design, API integration)  
- Validating with prototypes early (Agile’s "working software" principle)  

### 2. My Development Approach & Future Agile Practices  
I adopt iterative development with:  
- **Sprint planning** to prioritize high-value features  
- **Daily standups** to track blockers (used Jira for SNHU Travel)  
- **Retrospectives** to refine processes  
For future projects, I’ll incorporate:  
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** for clearer acceptance tests  
- **CI/CD pipelines** to automate deployments  

### 3. Traits of a Good Software Team Member  
- **Accountability:** Delivering sprint commitments (e.g., completing 100% of my SNHU Travel user stories)  
- **Adaptability:** Pivoting when requirements changed (e.g., adding hotel bookings mid-sprint)  
- **Collaboration:** Pair programming to resolve bugs faster  
- **Transparency:** Communicating blockers early in standups
